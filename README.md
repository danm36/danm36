Hi, my name is Daniel and I make things, mostly with code, and sometimes even with other people. I primarily operate as part of [NovaDawn Studios](https://github.com/NovaDawn-Studios) or as part of [The Lunar Inhabitants](https://github.com/LunarInhabitants), but I'll try to chip in with other open source repos too.

You can find my website and blog [here](https://masterof.dev/), although my posting schedule is...erratic.

I primarily either work with TypeScript/JavaScript, CSS and HTML if working on web software, or C# (and Visual Basic.NET if required) for desktop software and games. My primary game engine is [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I have a fair bit of experience with both [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) too.

My editor is either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, depending on project and need. I am (unfortunately) a Windows first developer, but I have cross OS development experience covering Mac and Linux too, and I'm not shy about working for those systems.

I'm currently working on a game as part of [NovaDawn Studios](https://github.com/NovaDawn-Studios), which will include open source software such as [MarkDialogue](https://github.com/NovaDawn-Studios/MarkDialogue), a MarkDown-to-Dialogue system for Unity, allowing the game's writers to write dialogue logic in a familiar style, yet have it work in the game immediately.
